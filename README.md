A Gulp Template
===============

It's a bitch to create a gulp setup for watching and combining sass, combining and minifing javascript and etc. Why not use this template and skip the boring stuff.

### Setup

1. Clone
2. Make sure node.js and npm are installed globally, derr
3. Run `npm install` or `sudo npm install` if barks errors at you
4. Run `bower install`
5. Run `gulp` to process javascript and sass or `gulp watch` to watch for changes
